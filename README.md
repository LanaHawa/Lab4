# Project Overview
  * This project was done in order to demonstrate and expand our knowledge on responsive webpage designs using CSS.
  * For responsive.html, we used a block display in order to format the page.
  * For flex.html, we used flexbox in order to format the page.
  * Both examples have 3 different media sizes supported.
